Explanation of these files:

- `orig.txt` was copied and pasted from the HTML table at
  http://emojinet.knoesis.org/emojipairs508_userstudy_embedding.htm. Its
  data is unhelpful because it only contains pictures of the emoji, not
  their codepoints or strings.

- `emojipairs.json` is a file that the authors e-mailed to fill in the data
  about which row numbers correspond to which emoji. However, in addition to
  being an ASCII JSON file, it has another layer of escaping, and also sticks
  underscores in the middle of flags. It appears that the authors have avoided
  confronting their software with actual emoji at all costs.

- With an interactive Jupyter session which will never have to be run again,
  I created `emosim-table.txt`, which combines the data extracted from these
  two files, and thus contains all the information in one place. It contains
  a table of tab-separated UTF-8 values, with a header row.

The only file that is needed for the evaluation is `emosim-table.txt`. The
other two files are just there for record-keeping.
